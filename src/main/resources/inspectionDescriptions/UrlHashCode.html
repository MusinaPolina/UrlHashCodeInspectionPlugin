<h2>Warning about calling java.net.Url#hashCode()</h2>
<p>If you are using Java and working with URLs, you may come across the method <code>java.net.Url#hashCode()</code>.
  It is important to note that calling this method can lead to unexpected behavior and performance
  problems.</p>
<h2>Why is calling Url#hashCode() a problem?</h2>
<p>The problem with calling <code>Url#hashCode()</code> is that it tries to resolve the host of the
  URL in order to compute its hash code. This can be a time-consuming operation, especially if the
  host is not immediately available or if there are issues with the network connection. Therefore,
  calling this method can potentially lead to performance problems.</p>

<h2>How to avoid problems with Url#hashCode()</h2>
<p>If you need to use hash codes with URL objects, it is recommended to use a custom hash code
  implementation that does not rely on resolving the host. This can be done by using a hash code
  algorithm that only takes into account the URL's string representation, such as the widely used
  "Jenkins hash".</p>
<p>If you are using a HashMap or HashSet that contains URL objects, you can create a custom
  implementation of the <code>Map</code> or <code>Set</code> interface that uses a custom hash code
  function to avoid calling <code>Url#hashCode()</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have a custom class that has a URL instance variable, you can override the <code>hashCode()</code>
  method to use a custom hash code implementation that avoids calling <code>Url#hashCode()</code>.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Calling <code>Url#hashCode()</code> can lead to unexpected behavior and performance problems, and
  should be avoided. If you need to use hash codes with URL objects, it is recommended to use a
  custom hash code implementation that does not rely on resolving the host.</p>
